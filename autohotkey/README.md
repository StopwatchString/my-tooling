# Authotkey Scripts

## ```macropad.ahk```

An autohotkey v2 script that's customized for my macropad, the [Keychron Q0 Plus](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q0-plus-qmk-custom-number-pad).

### Dependencies

This script is written with the expectation that you're on the latest version of Autohotkey v2.

### Setup

The ```MACROPAD_DEFAULT_FOLDER``` environment variable is checked to find where you want the macropad to default open folders/terminals at if you don't have an active explorer window to target. If not set, it will default to ```C:\dev\``` first, then ```C:\``` if that doens't exist.
